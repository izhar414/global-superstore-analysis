# 📊 Global Superstore Sales Analysis

Welcome to my data analysis project based on the **Global Superstore** dataset. This project demonstrates my skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization using Python in Jupyter Notebook.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights from the Global Superstore dataset, which contains detailed information on orders, sales, shipping, and profits across various countries and segments. Using Python, I explore trends and patterns to help improve business decision-making.

## 📁 Dataset

- **File name**: `Global_Superstore(CSV).csv`
- **Source**: Sample retail sales data for a fictional global superstore
- **Size**: ~50 columns and thousands of rows
- **Columns include**: Order ID, Order Date, Sales, Profit, Segment, Region, Product Name, Category, Sub-Category, etc.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

## 📊 Key Analyses Performed

- ✅ Data Cleaning (removing duplicates, handling missing values)
- ✅ Date formatting and feature extraction
- ✅ Total Sales by Region
- ✅ Top 10 Products by Sales
- ✅ Monthly Profit Trends
- ✅ Segment-wise and Category-wise Sales & Profit Analysis
- ✅ Visualizations for deeper understanding

## 📈 Visualizations

The following visualizations were created to support the analysis:

- Bar chart: Total Sales by Region
- Horizontal bar chart: Top 10 Products by Sales
- Line chart: Monthly Profit Trends
- Pie chart: Segment-wise Sales Distribution
- Grouped bar chart: Sales vs Profit by Category

---

## 📌 Insights

- Certain regions significantly outperform others in terms of sales.
- A handful of products contribute to the majority of revenue.
- Profit trends reveal seasonal patterns.
- Some segments and categories are more profitable than others.

## 💡 Learnings

Through this project, I strengthened my ability to:
- Clean and preprocess real-world datasets
- Use data visualization to tell compelling stories
- Draw actionable insights from raw data
- Work within Jupyter Notebook for end-to-end analysis
